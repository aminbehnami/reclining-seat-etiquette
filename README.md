# Is It Rude to Recline Your Seat on a Plane?

This repository contains a chart based on data from FiveThirtyEightâ€™s flying etiquette survey. I selected the question about reclining seats because it's a common debate during air travel.

## Chart Summary
- **502** people said it's *not rude at all*
- **281** said it's *somewhat rude*
- **71** said it's *very rude*

This indicates that while most are okay with reclining, a sizable group finds it inconsiderate.
